esas wage‘campaigner. Ata rally in WashingtonHeights this month, the Democraticnominee to become mayor of New YorkCity conducts a call-back of his mainpolicy pledges. “We're going...freezethe...” he begins. “Rent!” shouts theenthusiastic crowd. “Buses should befast and...” “Free!” “All shall have...”“Prizes!” (This last one is made up.)Aclear political offer is likely topropel Mr Mamdani to victory in themayoral election in November. Butleading a campaign is one thing. Makingthe sums add up in office is quite anoth-er. The context will require somethingdifferent from him.Spend time among the artificial-intelligence pioneers of San Francisco,and you'll also hear the word “context” alot. Frontier models are great at provid-ing generic answers, but specific ex-pertise is often needed to make themuseful. “General foundation models aretrained on mostly internet data orinally,” says Sarah Guo, the founder ofConviction, a venture-capital firm.“When I consult with my doctor about amedical case for myself or my child, Idon’t want them getting informationthat includes Reddit.”To yield the best results inside orga-nisations, Al applications need to betrained on relevant data, embedded inactual workflows and checked by peoplewith experience. To be effective theyneed to fit the context.What is true of politicians and Atmodels is true of bosses, too. The impor-tance of context to managers may soundobvious but it is often ignored. GaryJohns of Concordia University in Mon-treal attributes this blind spot to the“romance of leadership’, the idea thatthe innate qualities of individuals at thetop determine success or failure far morethan the environment in which they oper-ate. In fact, reality is as likely to distort youas the other way round.Crises change the way people manage,for example. A study by Janka Stoker of theUniversity of Groningen and her col-Teagues used subordinates’ assessments oftheir managers to see the effect of thefinancial crisis of 2007-09 on 20,000 boss-es across 36 countries. They found thatleaders became more directive, eventhough this is not necessarily the bestresponse. Another form of context, na-tional culture, helped determine just howbossy they became. They were morehands-on in count that are used tohierarchy, less so in consultative places.The external environment shapes‘managers in more subtle ways, too. Astudy by Daniel Keum and Stephan Meierof Columbia Business School found thatexpansions in unemployment-insuranceschemes in America were correlated withmore lay-offs. A more generous welfarestate apparently gave bosses greater licence to dismiss people.Leadership qualities are often con-text-dependent. Caring for others isaeefor instance, but sometimes a harderedge is needed. In their study of lay-offs,Messrs Keum and Meier also analysedthe preferences of the chief executiveswielding the knife. Kinder-hearted CEOslet more people go when such schemesbecame more generous, suggesting thatthey had been putting off necessaryrestructuring.The value of charisma is also con-tingent. It undoubtedly has the capacityto rouse people to greater effort. In anexperiment conducted by John Antona-kis of the University of Lausanne andco-authors, people who heard a motiva-tional speech before starting out on atask increased their output by 17% com-pared with people who got a bog-stan-dard, low-wattage address. This effect‘was roughly the same as that of beingoffered performance-related pay.But research suggests that charismacan be unnecessary among people wholike to work autonomously. Anotherstudy co-written by Ms Stoker found thatwhen senior leadership teams are adeptat directing themselves, an inspirationalboss has far less impact. Sometimes thesoapbox is superfluous.Good bosses do not bend with thewind. But they do adapt to their environ-ments. A multinational workforce meansmultiple cultural norms: some national-ities are happier to speak truth to power,and others need to be encouraged. Pro-jects ebb and flow: sometimes a leaderneeds to step in and sometimes theyneed to step back. When Mr Mamdaniwon the Democratic nomination in June,he got a call from Barack Obama. Thetwo spoke about the transition to gov-ering. Congratulations—and context.
